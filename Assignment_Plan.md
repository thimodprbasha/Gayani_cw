# Assignment Summary: 6COSC020W Coursework

## Overview
This coursework involves applying Artificial Intelligence techniques to a chosen problem domain. You are required to research, implementation a prototype using a Jupyter Notebook, and evaluate the solution.

**Total Marks:** 100
**Key Constraint:** The domain and AI technique implementation must be **different** from your Final Year Project (FYP) to avoid self-plagiarism.

## Part Breakdown

### Part A: Application Area Review (10 Marks)
- **Goal:** Choose a domain and write a 500-1000 word review on AI applications in that domain.
- **deliverable:** Text review listing relevant techniques and notable results.

### Part B: Compare and Evaluate AI Techniques (12 Marks)
- **Goal:** Select 3 relevant techniques from Part A.
- **Content:** For each technique (200-400 words each):
    - Describe how it applies to the domain.
    - Evaluate data availability, setup time, result time, and output.
    - Discuss strengths, weaknesses, advantages, and disadvantages.
    - Compare input data requirements and expected outputs.

### Part C: Implementation (48 Marks)
- **Goal:** Select ONE technique from Part B to implement as a prototype.
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook.
- **Sub-tasks:**
    1.  **Architecture (5 marks):** High-level diagram of the system elements.
    2.  **Input Data (4+4 marks):** Describe input format and pre-processing required.
    3.  **Prototype (30 marks total):**
        - Data implementation (5 marks)
        - Code quality (5 marks)
        - Technique implementation (20 marks)
        - Output/Visualisation (5 marks)

### Part D: Software Testing and Evaluation (20 Marks)
- **Goal:** Verify the implementation.
- **Content:**
    - Describe testing methods.
    - Compare expected vs. actual results (5 marks).
    - Assess effectiveness and interpret results in context (10 marks).
    - Discuss strengths and limitations (5 marks).

### Part E: EDI and Sustainability (10 Marks)
- **Goal:** Critical evaluation.
- **Content:**
    - **EDI (5 marks):** Bias, fairness, accessibility, inclusion, ethical implications.
    - **Sustainability (5 marks):** Computational resources, data storage, suggestions for reducing environmental impact.
